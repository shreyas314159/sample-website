    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <p>
   HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
      Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
      share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    	   Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the
      <a href="https://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the
      <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>.
      This page is part of the sample site for
      <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to
      Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of

    <h3>Founders</h3>

    <p>
    	Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Harti, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication
taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a billion people, and probably more.
